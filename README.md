# Iron Oxide
Iron Oxide is a mini web-browser written entirely in rust. Currently it can make a single html request to any url and parse the response body as html.

My goal is to make it a command line bsaed web browser, similar to Lynx. But in the future I would like to improve Iron Oxide and give it graphical support.
